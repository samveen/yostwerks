The kayaks in this manual are designed for good performance, ease of construction, and low cost. <b>All designs, all plans, and all instructions in this manual are "free".</b>  Unlke most commercial folding kayaks, these boats are narrow, shallow, and light weight.   Many of the designs are based on traditional Inuit (Greenland) and Aleut ( Baidarka) kayaks. The boats fall into four general categories.<br>
<p>
<b>1.  Performance</b> -  Sea Rover, Sea Ranger, Sea Rider, Sea Raider,<br> Sea Glider, Nikumi 19 
<p>
<b>2.  Touring</b> - Sea Cruiser, Sea Tour 13,15,17, Sea Otter, Nikumi, Yarra
<p>
<b>3.  Children / Small Paddler</b> -  Sea Flea, Sea Pup, Sea Otter
<p>
<b>4.  Inflatables</b> -  Sonnet 16 and Sonnet 18<br>
<p>
<b> <a href="MainMenu.html">Folder Construction</a></B> is of aluminum stringers, HDPE (plastic) cross sections, and a lightweight PVC skin. Construction time is approximately 100 hrs. with costs averaging $500.00US. Kayak assembly times are under 30 minutes. Use the <B>{Back}</B> key to return. Folder construction is a simplified version of the Feathercraft technique.<br>
<p>
<b> <a href="WoodSOFFrameMenu.html">Wood frame (non-folder) construction</a></B> is approximately 65 hrs. with costs averaging $200.00. Any design, except inflatables, in the manual that can be constructed as a folding kayak can also be constructed as a wood frame non-folder. Use the <B>{Back}</B> key to return. Wood frame construction is based in part on the techniques of George Dyson.<br>
<p>
<b> <a href="InflatableMain.html">Inflatable / folder hybrid construction</a></B></b> ( 4 sponsons / 3 aluminum stringers) is approximately 50hrs. with costs averaging $250.00.  Assembly times average 10 minutes. Use the <B>{Back}</B> key to return.<br>
<p>
Detailed folder Instructions are found in the <b>"Frame Construction"</b> and <b>"PVC Skinning"</b> sections of the Main Menu.  Several hundred photos are included to assist in the construction process. Construction pics, drawings, offsets, and descriptions of the various designs are found in the <b>Design Menu</b>. The <b>Contacts</b> pages of the Main Menu provide Links to material sources for North American builders. The <b>"New Completions"</b> section of the Main Menu displays the latest homebuilder completions from around the world. 
<p>
All designs in this manual, except inflatables, can be constructed in woodstrip/fiberglass or stitch & glue (S&G) versions, though instructions are not provided for these hardshell versions.
