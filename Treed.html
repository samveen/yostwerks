Terry, from Massachusetts, displays his Sea Tour 15-R.  He modified the offsets slightly to raise the deck 5/8" and the deckridge  an inch. The  final size is 16' long, 22" wide, 12" deep and weighs 38 lbs. The frame is marine plywood with clear pine stringers, oak floorboards  and coaming. The coaming was made by laminating 3/32" oak strips and  required no steam bending (just wrapped the strips with a wet cloth  for a few minutes before bending). Skinning materials are from Corey Freedman (850 original nylon, 2-part  urethane, amber dye). It's finished off with a Snap Dragon backband, Skwoosh sitting pad,  and Spirit Line floatation bags. Terry's comments .... " I couldn't be happier with the results. I was looking for a light, fast  touring boat for inland lakes and rivers and that's what I got."  Terry has documented the building process at the following <b> <a href=http://www.gypsywranglers.com/kayakBuild/index.html>LINK. </a></B> Use the <B>{Back}</B> key to return.
