<b>Upper Left</b> -  The coaming is 1/2" aluminum tubing.  The seat is 3/16 plywood with a 1/2" closed cell foam pad. It slips under the lower sponsons during assembly and is held firmly in place after the sponsons are inflated. The cross braces are 3/4" tubing. They connect to the opposite stringer and keel via HDPE snaps.<br>
<b>Upper Right</b> -  The 3 stringer frame , deckridge, and coaming supports.<br>
<b>Lower Left</b> -  The 15' X 3.5" Folbot sponsons are protected by 10oz PVC sleeves.<br> 
<b>Lower Right</b>  -  The Wood "Skinning" frame with sponson sleeves and aluminum keel attached prior to skinning. The 10oz PVC  sleeves will be glued to the 18oz PVC skin .  Both will later be removed from the wood frame. The frame is not part of the finished boat, but can be used to make future skins.<br> 
<p>
The skin is 18oz Coverene, and the sponsons sleeves are 10oz Coverene from Mauritzon. The aluminum tubing is 6063-T832 from Texas Towers. Sponsons are 15' X 3.5" from Folbot. The cost to build the Sonnet 18 was $225.00US.
