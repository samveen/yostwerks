<p>
The <b> <a href=http://www.yostwerks.com/InflatableMain.html>Sonnet 16 </a></B> is an inflatable / folder hybrid.  The frame is comprised of 4 sponsons and 3 aluminum stringers.  The skin is 10oz Coverene PVC.  The boats dimensions are 16.2' X 21" X 19.5 lbs ( 495cm X 53cm X 8.8kg).  Bag to boat assembly is consistently under 10 minutes, with disassembly under 5 minutes.  

In the initial trial, the boat averaged 4.6 mph for one hours paddling at a moderate touring pace.  A 94" X 2.75" Greenland paddle (GP) was used.  Weathercocking was minimal, tracking was good, and turning very quick when edged.  As a further test, one "lower" sponson was deflated and the boat felt stable and tracked well.  It was re-inflated on the water and the opposite side "upper" sponson was deflated with similar results. Build time was 45hrs. with a cost of $225.00.  Use the <B>{Back}</B> key to return.
