<b>Wood Sanding</b> - The frame is sanded with 120 / 220 sandpaper, with and without a sanding block.  All edges are sanded to round them a bit.  How much you sand is up to you.  I probably spent less than an hour sanding the entire boat.<br>  

<b>Epoxy Sanding</b> - Epoxy is sanded between coats or in preparation for a urethane final coat to remove a film called "amine blush".  Use a lightweight sanding pad that was been moistened with water.  After sanding this way, wipe down the plywood surface with a damp cloth and allow to dry completely before applying a second epoxy or Urethane coat.<br> 

<b>Coating Cross Sections, Coaming, Stems -</b>  All plywood edges are double coated with epoxy resin.  All other plywood surfaces are single coated. All plywood is final coated with urethane. Both epoxy and urethane are applied with a brush.<br>

<b>Coating Stringers ( redwood) and Floor (pine) -</b>  All softwood is double coated with Watco "Natural" Oil. Watco is applied quickly with a soft cloth. A second coat can be applied within 30 minutes.  If the second coat "stands" on the surface after about 15 minutes, wipe it off with a soft cloth.  Watco is very easy to apply and is also an excellent coating for a GP.
