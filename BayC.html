Davids Comments.....<br> 
<p>
" The Sonnet has been drawing continued interest from people at the launch sites and on the beach, etc. People seem to like the idea of a lightweight inflatable kayak that also performs well and actually looks like a kayak. I talked to a couple of kayakers on the beach at Napatree who said they watched me paddle around the point and were impressed with the way the Sonnet was riding the swells"
