The Sea Rover zipper is attached to the forward deck. The zipper slider is located inside the coaming. The slider could also be located at the bow.
<p>
Due to it's forward deck location, the zipper is longer than if located on the aft deck. Also, the longer, sloping forward deck makes zipper installation a bit more difficult.
<p>
An advantage to the forward deck location is the ease of sliding the frame in or out of the shorter aft skin during kayak assembly.

<BR>
The Sea Rider has an aft deck zipper location with the slider positioned at the stern.
<p>
The zipper is shorter in this setup, plus the flat deck makes installation easier. Though not a problem, the longer forward deck with it's more compound shape makes sliding the frame in and out just a bit more difficult. Overall, this is probably the better solution.
