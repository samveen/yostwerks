<div align=justify>
The deck tie-downs are made of thin strips of PVC with plastic, brass, or stainless D-Rings attached to secure the 1/8" or 3/16" shock cords. These have proven to be very durable, and are even used to secure the carrying straps.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
The shock cords are tied to the forward most D-Ring and  laced in a continuous "X" pattern. After lacing, the opposite end of the shock cord is secured to the original D-Ring with an aluminum or stainless connector, either home-made or purchased. As an alternative, both ends of the shock cord can be tied to the D-Ring and one can be untied for dis-assembly. The ends of the shock cords are seared to prevent fraying. (Combi-Single)
