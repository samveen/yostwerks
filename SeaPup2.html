<B>NOTE:</B>  There is no peaked deckridge at Cross sections 1, 4, 5, and 6 as the deck is flat topped at those sections. Only Cross Section 2 and 3 are peaked.
<p>
The curvature/Slope that appears to be a peaked deck, is actually the gunwale (sheer) slope. The offset drawing states "Gunwale" in green print." , but that is not to be confused with a peaked deck.   The deckridge on sections 1, 4, 5, amd 6 are  the same height as the gunwale height ( HAB) so they are flat across the top.
<p>
It's easiest to understand this when looking at the side view of the boat in the 3-View drawing above. The only cross section  that is peaked is cross section 2 and 3.  The deckridge begins sloping upward at section 1 and ends at section 3.  
<p> 
Cross Section 2 and 3 are labeled <b>"Deckridge  (Section 2 or Section 3)"</B> on the offset drawing. The peaked section 3 has a .250 ft  ( 3") flat section on top as this is the attachment point for the front of the coaming. The back of the coaming rests on the flat topped cross section 3.
