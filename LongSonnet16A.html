David, from Connecticut, has completed a <b> <a href="InflatableMain.html">Sonnet 16 </a></B> Inflatable / Folder hybrid.  He previously constructed both a <b> <a href="DavidSeaRanger1.html">Sea Ranger LC and Sea Tour 17-R</a></B>.  The Sonnet 16 dimensions are 16' X 21" X 20lbs. with a 10 minute assembly. Use the <B>{Back}</B> key to return. Below are some of his comments regarding the Sonnet 16. <br>
<p>
..... "Overall, I like the Sonnet a lot.  For general paddling in the lakes, rivers, and marshes
around here, I would take the Sonnet before both the Sea Tour and the Sea Ranger. The initial stability is
better than both. It's a very relaxing boat to paddle. The boat tracks well and turns easily.....The inflated sponsons and side stringers give the hull more stiffness than I had anticipated......The Sonnet is a real recreational kayak and I mean that in the best possible way. I can have a boat in the car for
the times when I happen upon a place that looks interesting to paddle..... The bow of the sonnet rises up more over the waves whereas the Sea Ranger seems to punch through more."<br>
<p>
Ocean Paddling...."The Sonnet is great in the swells and tidal currents - tracks well ...... it has far exceeded any expectations that I had when I started."
