<B>Attaching Coaming to Frame</B> -  The coaming lip is attached to the coaming with 1/2" or 5/8" wood screws.  The base plate stays
independent of the other two sections.  Next, the 3 coaming rings are attached through the deckridge and cross sections 4 and 5 with
2ea. X 10 / 24 machine screws/nuts to create a secure bond to the frame.  The stiff coaming, combined with it's secure attachment
adds rigidity to the frame.  Two additional machine screws are used to secure the sides of the 3 coaming rings together.  A wood
coaming, though similar, can be glued between the lip and coaming.
