 <p>
<B>NOTE:</B>  There is no peaked deckridge at Cross sections 1, 3 and 4 for either of the Sea Flea's as the deck is flat topped at those sections. Only Cross Section 2 is peaked.
<p>
The curvature/Slope that appears to be a peaked deck, is actually the gunwale (sheer) slope. The offset drawing states "Gunwale" in green print." , but that is not to be confused with a peaked deck.   The deckridge on sections 1, 3 and 4 are  the same height as the gunwale height ( HAB) so they are flat across the top.
<p>
It's easiest to understand this when looking at the side view of the boat in the 3-View drawing above. The only cross section on either boat that is peaked is cross section 2.  The deckridge begins sloping upward at section 1 and ends at section 2.  
<p> 
Cross Section 2 is labeled <b>"Deck (Section 2)"</B> on the offset drawing. The peaked section 2 has a .2 ft  ( 2.4") flat section on top as this is the attachment point for the front of the coaming. The back of the coaming rests on the flat topped cross section 3.
