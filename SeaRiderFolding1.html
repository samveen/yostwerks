1.  All tubes are connected by 1/8" shock cords. The gunwales, chines, and keel have 6 tube sections.  The forward and aft deckridge have 4 sections each.
The stringers are left connected to the bow at all times. This is a change from earlier folding methods.  Except for the keel and deckridge, stringers are disconnected at the stern.  
<p>
2.  The stringers are layed out on the ground.  Cross sections and floor are positioned in their approximate assembly location.
<p>
3.  Cross sections and floor are attached and stringers are connected at the stern.
