<p>
Michael, a German living in Birmingham, Michigan has completed a Sonnet 16 ... 488cm X 53cm ( 16' X 21").  Assembly is less than 10 minutes,  weight is about 10kg ( 22lbs), and cost to build $400.00. The PVC skin consists of an 18oz hull, 14oz deck, and 10oz sponson sleeves. Michael is seen paddling at Key Largo, Florida while on holiday. Michael's comments .... On the water I was very pleased and happy with it. Easy to accelerate, it felt as fast as the Feathercraft Wisper but it behaved even a bit better in quartering seas/wind. Excellent to control, goes straight when it should and still turns easy if required. It fit's me like a glove (5'11", inseam 34", 158 pds). On the picture it didn't have any fittings on it...
